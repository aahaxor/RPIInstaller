# RPIInstaller
RPIInstaller is a simple collection of Shell scripts that I use to install a few programs that I use a lot on the Raspberry Pi. This script will allow you to install common utilities like OpenCV, WebIOPi, and much more without the hassle of using the command line.
I hope you enjoy :)
